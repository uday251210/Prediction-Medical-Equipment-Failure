# Prediction-Medical-Equipment-Failure
## Overview
Medical equipment is the backbone of modern healthcare. From ventilators and dialysis machines to MRI scanners and infusion pumps, these devices are critical for patient diagnosis and treatment.  
However, equipment failure can cause:
- **Unexpected downtime** in hospitals.
- **High maintenance costs** due to reactive repairs.
- **Potential risks** to patient safety.

This project aims to **predict medical equipment failure** using historical sensor data, usage logs, and maintenance records. By applying **machine learning techniques**, the system can identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of failure, allowing hospitals to take **preventive maintenance actions**.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a **data-driven predictive model** for medical equipment failure.  
- Reduce **unplanned downtime** in healthcare facilities.  
- Enable **proactive maintenance scheduling**.  
- Provide **visual insights** into equipment health and failure patterns.
